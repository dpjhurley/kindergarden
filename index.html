            <p>We believe children should stay children as long as they need and the fact that they enter 1st grade
                should not end their childhood. We intertwine playing and learning at such an early age and encourage
                our students to enjoy learning.</p>

            <h3 id="us">about us</h3>

            <p>We began as a visionary venture in 1998 when Dr. Gabriel and Alish Black, world-class academics in the
                field of economics, endeavored to find a way to prepare students for college and the real world better
                than schools did at the time. They quickly found that the best way to make students thrive was simple:
                challenge them. After opening their first school in 1998, the Blocks discovered that students, when
                given a well-crafted curriculum and teachers who truly cared about teaching it, were able to learn at
                exceedingly high levels, meeting and surpassing the best students in the world. What began as a single
                campus has grown to become a unique, high-achieving, and unprecedented network of schools.</p>
